# Project Management Dashboard

FastAPI backend for a project management dashboard with Postgres, JWT authentication,
S3-compatible document storage, and later Lambda-based background processing.

## Phase 1

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Then visit:

- API health: http://localhost:8000/health
- OpenAPI docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

Local development uses Postgres and LocalStack through Docker Compose.

## Data Model

Phase 2 uses a normalized relational design:

- `users` stores one row per account.
- `projects` stores project metadata and points to the owning user.
- `project_access` stores project membership and role, so a project can have
  many users without duplicating user or project data.
- `documents` stores document metadata and points to its parent project.

The deliberate denormalization is `projects.total_size_bytes`. The normalized
source of truth is still the `documents.size_bytes` rows, but keeping the total
on `projects` lets the API check project storage limits without running a
`SUM()` over documents on every project read. The tradeoff is that uploads,
deletes, and later the Lambda size recompute need to keep that counter correct.

The real application uses SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations. The
`app/db/raw/` folder contains a plain SQL schema plus asyncpg examples for the
course requirement to show the same database work without an ORM.

## Project Endpoints

Phase 4 adds JWT-protected project management endpoints:

- `POST /projects` creates a project and grants the creator the `owner` role.
- `GET /projects` lists projects the current user can access, including nested
  document metadata.
- `GET /project/{project_id}/info` returns one accessible project.
- `PUT /project/{project_id}/info` lets owners or participants edit name and
  description.
- `DELETE /project/{project_id}` is owner-only and prepares the S3 cleanup path
  that Phase 5 will fill in with real object deletion.
